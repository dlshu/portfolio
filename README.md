## Selected Projects
- ### A physics-informed diffusion model for high-fidelity flow field reconstruction ([paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999123000670) | [code](https://github.com/BaratiLab/Diffusion-based-Fluid-Super-resolution/tree/main_v1))

A denoising diffusion probablistic model for robust super-resolution of turbulent flow data. Currently in the process of being incoprated to [modulus](https://github.com/NVIDIA/modulus).
